\beginverse
I don't know,
I don't know how to use a surfboard,
But I know how to drive a Ford, Or a Chevy, or a Plymouth or an Oldsmobile,
You must be thinking,
You must be thinking of the boy in the next row,
Your ice cream is melting so slow, that it's dripping,
You better start licking.
I always thought girls knew a lot more than boys.
I always thought girls knew a lot more than boys.

\beginverse
It's getting hot,
The sun is getting hot,
I think I look for a new spot where there's no sun,
But shadow, I got melting marshmellows,
I always thought girls knew a lot more than boys.
I always thought girls knew a lot more than boys.

\beginverse
Here she comes,
Here she comes with her long blond hair,
Is she gonna trick or treat... ?
In the summer, in the sand and in this heat,
I always thought girls knew a lot more than boys.
I always thought girls knew a lot more than boys.
In the summer, in the sand and in this heat,
In the summer, in the sand and in this heat,

Here she comes, Here she comes, Here she comes, Here she comes,
Come on... Come on... Come on...
