\beginchorus
You gotta keep 'em separated
\endchorus

\beginverse
Like the latest fashion, \brk  Like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease

The gangs stake their own campus locale
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hey man you talkin' back to me?, \brk  Take him out, \brk  \echo{You gotta keep 'em separated}
Hey man you disrespecting me?, \brk  Take him out, \brk  \echo{You gotta keep 'em separated}
Hey don't pay no mind, \brk  You're under 18 you won't be doing any time, \brk  \echo{Hey come out and play}
\endchorus

\beginverse
By the time you hear the siren, \brk  It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail, \brk  One guy's wasted and the other's a waste

It goes down the same as the thousand before, \brk  No one's getting smarter no one's learning the score
Your never-ending spree of death and violence, and hate, \brk  Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own
\endverse

Hey don't pay no mind, \brk  You're under 18 you won't be doing any time, \brk  \echo{Hey come out and play}
