\beginsong{I Alone (LIVE)}

\beginverse
it's easier not to be wise	\\
and measure these things by your brains	\\
I sank into Eden with you	\\
alone in the church by and by	\\
I'll read to you here, save your eyes	\\
you'll need them, your boat is at sea	\\
your anchor is up, you've been swept away	\\
and the greatest of teachers won't hesitate	\\
to leave you there, by yourself, chained to fate
\endverse


\beginverse
I alone love you,	\brk I alone tempt you	\\
I alone love you,	\brk fear is not the end of this!	
\endverse


\beginverse
it's easier not to be great	\\
and measure these things by your eyes	\\
we long to be here by his resolve	\\
alone in the church by and by	\\
to cradle the baby in space	\\
and leave you there by yourself chained to fate	
\endverse


\beginverse
oh, now, we took it back too far,	\\
only love can save us now,	\\
all these riddles that you burn	\\
all come runnin' back to you,	\\
all these rhythms that you hide	\\
only love can save us now,	\\
all these riddles that you burn yeah, yeah, yeah	
\endverse
