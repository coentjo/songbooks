\beginsong{I Alone (LIVE)}

\beginverse
it's \[G]easier \[D]not to be \[C]wise \[Cmaj7], \brk And measure these things by your brains	
I sank into Eden with you, \brk Alone in the church by and by
I'll read to you here, save your eyes, \brk You'll need them, your boat is at sea
Your anchor is up, you've been swept away, \brk  And the greatest of teachers won't hesitate	
to \[B]leave you there, by yourself, chained to fate
\endverse

\beginchorus

\endchorus

\beginverse
It's \[G]easier \[D]not to be \[C]great,  \brk	And measure these things by your eyes	
We long to be here by his resolve,  \brk  Alone in the church by and by	
To cradle the baby in space,   
And \[B]leave you there by yourself chained to fate

Oh, now, we took it back too far,

All these riddles that you burn yeah, yeah, yeah
