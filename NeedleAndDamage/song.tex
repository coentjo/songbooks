\beginsong{The Needle and the Damage done }[by=Neil Young]




\beginverse
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done

I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done
\endverse

\beginverse
I sing the song because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk blood to keep from running out

I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's like a settin' sun
\endverse
