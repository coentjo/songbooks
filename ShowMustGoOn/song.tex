\beginverse
I must accept these consequences for my actions,
When all I did was what the world told me I should do.
And do anything for my dreams, if only I knew.
The cost of my dreams AKA you, would be you.
I'm dead now!
\endverse

\beginchorus
The nightmare,   \brk   Is slowly taking over,
All that's happened,   \brk   It is enabling him
To take exactly what he wants,   \brk   Until he gets what he desires, \brk  We'll be at his whim.
\endchorus

\beginchorus
My inner demon, he is screamin' at me, `Take her now!
This is your only chance, won't get another, don't let me down!
Don't fucking whine, the deed is done you'll be just fine.
So you want true romance? Throw the dice, take a chance.'
\endchorus

\beginverse
Why won't you let me in? \echo{Just let me in!}
We'll masquerade this awkward phase that we're stuck in!
If you accept me and forever be by my side,
Remember what I said? Every day's a new sunrise.
So let's just act pretend like this never happened,
I'm your arcane guardian, \brk  Just let me in.
\endverse

\beginchorus
You know our love is caught in your eyes, \brk  And those hazel eyes,  \brk  They terrorize, they terrorize!
\endchorus

\beginchorus
My inner demon ...
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Don't let me down,   \brk   If I can't have you, I will never be found.
It's sure to kill me if you leave me,  \brk  So I'll leave you gagged and bound.
I won't reside, never abide, \brk  I won't live my life caught in a lie.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Baby, don't scream, \brk  Don't scream, you are not alone!
His arms are not your new home, \brk  Now just close your eyes, you will never say goodbye!
Baby don't scream, \brk  You know I did this all for you and me!
Tell me why!, \brk  Don't fucking scream, you know I did this all just for me!
\endverse

\beginchorus
You know our love is caught in your eyes, \brk  And those hazel eyes,  \brk  They terrorize, they terrorize!
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Don't let me down, ...
\endchorus

\beginchorus
There's no escape, from this place!
\echo{But somehow you unlocked all the chains.
Paralyzed in authentic fear, \brk  Cause I'm insane, and I'm deranged.
You mustn't share twisted affairs with all your peers,
So I'll push you down the stairs, \brk  And lock you down there in the dark for years!}
\endchorus

\beginverse
This cannot be, it must be a dream!, \brk  I can't bare this harsh reality, \brk  She's my only destiny
We must create, our own fate, \brk  I took her life, now it's too late. 
(This Darkness Has overcome your common sense
Be honest, Impulsive actions made a mess
This darkness, \brk  Like a fire burning red
So vicious, \brk  A heartless monster not a man)
\endverse

\beginchorus
I watched their lust, it sparked alive
And it tore me up inside
I will admit I'm terrified,
Let jealousy serve as my guide
I can't reside, I can't abide
Can't live my life caught in this lie
So I must die, goodbye goodnight!
\endchorus
