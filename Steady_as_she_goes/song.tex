Find yourself a girl, and settle down
Live a simple life in a quiet town

Steady as she goes \echo{steady as she goes}
Steady as she goes \echo{steady as she goes}
So steady as she goes

Your friends have shown a kink in the single life
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife
\endverse

Steady as she goes \echo{steady as she goes}
So Steady as she goes \echo{steady as she goes}
Well here we go a\[G]gain, you've found your\[A]self a friend, that knows you \[B]well
But no matter what you \[G]do, you'll always \[A]feel as though you tripped and \[E]fell
So steady as she goes

\beginverse
When you have completed what you thought you had to do
And your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue

Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along
