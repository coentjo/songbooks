\beginverse
Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag

So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off to look for America
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now

It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces

She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera

Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago

So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
\endverse

\beginverse
Cathy, I'm lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping
And I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America
\endverse
