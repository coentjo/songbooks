\beginverse
Many's the time I've been mistaken, and many times confused
And I've often felt forsaken, and certainly misused.
But it's all right, it's all right, I'm just weary to my bones
Still, you don't expect to be, bright and Bon Vivant
So far away from home, so far away from home.
\endverse

\beginverse
I don't know a soul who's not been battered
Don't have a friend who feels at ease
Don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to its knees.
But it's all right, all right,
We've lived so well so long
Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on,
I wonder what went wrong,
I can't help it

I wonder what went wrong.
\endverse

\beginverse
And I dreamed I was flying. I dreamed my soul rose unexpectedly,
and looking back down on me, smiled reassuringly,
and I dreamed I was dying. And far above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty, drifting away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying.
\endverse

\beginverse
We come on a ship we call the Mayflower,
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come at the age's most uncertain hour
And sing the American tune
But it's all right, its all right
You can't be forever blessed
Still, tomorrow's gonna be another working day
And I'm trying to get some rest,
That's all, I'm trying to get some rest.
\endverse
