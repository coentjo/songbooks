%{\nolyrics Intro: \[E] \[G] \[A]}


\beginverse
Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes

No one really knows about your soul
And I barely really know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
And a bunch of fools drown in shame
\endverse

\beginchorus
Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
\endchorus

\beginverse
Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harms way?
Warding off all evil signs
But never really kept you safe

Now you're too young for the golden age
'Cause the record bin's been replaced
27 gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink
\endverse

\beginchorus
Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of...
\endchorus

\beginverse
Amy please don't go!
Amy please don't go!

Is your heart singing out of tune
Are your eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes

May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep
\endverse

\beginchorus
Amy don't you go
I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine? ads
