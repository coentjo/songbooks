\endverse

\beginverse
\[D] Is your heart singing \[Bm]out of tune?  \brk  Are your \[G]eyes just singing the bl\[D]ues?
\[D] Dirty records from an\[Bm]other time,   \brk   Some bl\[G]ood stains on your sh\[A]oes

\[D] No one really knows ab\[Bm]out your soul,   \brk   And I \[G]barely really know your n\[D]ame
\[D] Burning rhythms and p\[F\#m]osting lies,   \brk   And a b\[G]unch of fools dr\[A]own in sh\[D]ame
\endverse

\beginchorus
Amy don't you g\[Bm]o,   \brk   I want you ar\[D]ound
Singin' w\[Bm]oah pl\[F\#m]ease don't go
Do you w\[G]anna be a fr\[A]iend of m\[D]ine?
Do you w\[G]anna be a fr\[A]iend of m\[Bm]ine? \ \[ F\#m Bm F\#m] 
\endchorus

\beginverse
Did you tattoo a lucky charm,   \brk   To keep you out of harms way?
Warding off all evil signs,   \brk   But never really kept you safe

Now you're too young for the golden age,   \brk   'Cause the record bin's been replaced
27 gone without a trace,   \brk   And you walked away from your drink
\endverse

\beginchorus
Amy don't you go,   \brk   I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of...

(2x)  \  Amy please don't go!
\endchorus

\[D] Is your heart singing \[Bm]out of tune?  \brk  Are your \[G]eyes just singing the bl\[D]ues?
\[D] Dirty records from an\[Bm]other time,   \brk   Some bl\[G]ood stains on your sh\[A]oes

May I have this last dance
By chance if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby?
So we can sing you to sleep

\beginchorus
Amy don't you go,   \brk   I want you around
Singin' woah please don't go
(3x) \ Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
