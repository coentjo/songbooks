\beginverse
\[C]I am just a poor boy,  \brk  Though my \[C]story's \[G/B]seldom \[Am]told
I have \[G]squandered my resistance,  \brk  For a \[G7]pocketful of mumbles Such are \[C]promises
All \[G/B]lies and \[Am]jest,  \brk  Still, a \[G]man hears what he \[F]wants to hear,  \brk  And disregards the \[C]rest \[G  \  C  ] 
\endverse

\beginverse
When I \[C]left my home and my family,  \brk  I was \[C]no more \[G/B]than a \[Am]boy
In the \[G]company of strangers,  \brk  In the \[G7]quiet of a railway station \[C]Running scared
\[G/B]Laying \[Am]low, seeking \[G]out the poorer \[F]quarters,  \brk  Where the ragged people \[C]go
Looking \[G]for the places \[G7]only they would \[C]know
\endverse

\beginchorus
Lie la \[Am]lie,  \brk  Lie la \[G]lie, lie lie la lie, 
Lie la \[Am]lie,  \brk  Lie la \[F]lie, la lie la \[G]lie la la la la \[C]lie. 
\endchorus

\beginverse
Asking \[C]only workman's wages,  \brk  I come \[C]looking \[G/B]for a \[Am]job,  \brk  But I get no \[G]offers
Just a \[G7]come-on from the whores on Seventh \[C]Avenue
\[C] I \[G/B]do de\[Am]clare there were \[G]times when I was \[F]so lonesome,  \brk  I took some comfort \[C]there
\endverse

\beginchorus
Lie-la-\[G]lie la lie lie, \[G7]lie lie la \[C]lie
\endchorus

\beginverse
Then I'm \[C]laying out my winter clothes,  \brk  And \[C]wishing \[G/B]I was \[Am]gone,  \brk  Going \[G]home
Where the \[G7]New York City winters aren't \[C]bleeding me
\[G/B]Leading \[Am]me,  \brk  Going \[G]home \[G7 \ C] 
\endverse

\beginverse
In the \[C]clearing stands a boxer,  \brk  And a \[C]fighter \[G/B]by his \[Am]trade,  \brk  And he \[G]carries the remainders
Of \[G7]every glove that laid him down,  \brk  And \[C]cut him till he cried out,  \brk  In his \[C]anger \[G/B]and his \[Am]shame
“I am \[G]leaving, I am \[F]leaving”,  \brk  But the fighter still re\[C]mains  \[G \ G7 \ C ] 
\endverse

\beginchorus
Lie-la-\[Am]lie lie la \[G]lie lie lie la lie,  \brk  Lie-la-\[Am]lie lie la \[F]lie lie lie la \[G]lie la la la la
