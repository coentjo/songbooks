\beginverse
You \[D]say \[G]we've got \[A]nothing in \[D]common
No \[G]common \[A]ground to \[D]start from
And \[G]we're fal\[A]ling a\[D]part  \[G]  \[A] 
You'll \[D]say the \[G]world has \[A]come be\[D]tween us
Our \[G]lives have \[A]come be\[D]tween us
\[G] still I \[A]know you just \[D]don't care  \[G] \[A]

\beginchorus
And \[D]I said what about "\[A]Breakfast at \[G]Tiffany's?
She \[D]said, "I think I re\[A]member the \[G]film, And 
As \[D]I recall, I think, we \[A]both kinda \[G]liked it."
And \[D]I said, "Well, that's the \[A]one thing we've \[G]got."
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[D]I see you're the \[G]only \[A]one who \[D]knew me
And \[G]now your \[A]eyes see \[D]through me
\[G] I \[A]guess I was \[D]wrong
So \[D]what now? It's \[G]plain to \[A]see we're \[D]over,
And I \[G]hate when \[A]things are \[D]over
When \[G]so much is \[A]left un\[D]done
