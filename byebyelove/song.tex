\beginsong{Bye Bye Love}[by=The Everly brothers]


\beginchorus
    Bye bye love, \brk  Bye bye happiness
    Hello loneliness, \brk  I think I'm gonna cry
    Bye bye love, \brk  Bye bye sweet caress, 
    Hello emptiness, \brk  I feel like I could die
    Bye bye my love goodbye
\endchorus

\beginverse
There goes my baby, \brk  With someone new
She sure looks happy, \brk  I sure am blue
She was my baby, \brk  'Till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance, \brk  That might have been
\endverse

\beginverse
I'm through with romance, \brk  I'm through with love
I'm through with counting, \brk  The stars above
And here's the reason, \brk  That I'm so free
My loving baby, \brk  Is through with me
