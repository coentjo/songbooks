\beginsong{Call it love }[by=Poco]


\beginverse
We've got all night, Let's take our time
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
When it makes us feel better, Call it love
\endverse

\beginverse
You say you won't, I say you will
You make me crazy, But I want you still
When it makes us feel better, Call it love
\endverse

\beginverse
Do we tell the truth, Or do we live a lie
Is the feeling good, Is that what makes you cry
When you say those words, Look me in the eye
Tell me why you call it love
\endverse

\beginverse
I play my hand, You call my bluff
We push each other, 'Til we've had enough
When it's all you've got, Call it love
\endverse

\beginverse
If I didn't have money, Would you want me still
When you look real close, Do we fit the bill
Call it what you want, But only time will tell
\endverse

\beginverse
Do we tell the truth, Or do we live a lie
Is the feeling good, Is that what makes you cry
When you say those words, Look me in the eye
Tell me why you call it love
\endverse

\beginverse
We've got all night, Let's take our time
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
When it makes us feel better, Call it love
Call it love, Call it love, Call it love
When it's all you've got, Call it love
\endverse
