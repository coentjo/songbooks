\beginsong{Cats in the cradle}[by=Harry Chapin]


\beginverse
A \[E]child arrived just the \[G]other day
He \[A]came to the world in the \[E]usual way
But there were \[E]planes to catch and \[G]bills to pay
\[A] He learned to walk while I \[E]was away
And he was \[D]talkin 'fore I \[D/Cis]knew it and \[D/B]as he grew he'd say \[D/A]
\[D/G]I'm gonna \[D/Fis]be like \[E]you, dad
You \[G]know I'm gonna \[G/Fis]be like \[E]you
\endverse

\beginchorus
And the \[E]cats in the cradle and the \[D]silver spoon
\[G]Little boy blue and the \[A]man in the moon
\[E]When you coming home Dad, I \[D]don't know when
\[G] We'll get to\[G/Fis]gether \[E]then
You \[G]know we'll have a \[G/Fis]good time \[E]then.
\endchorus

\beginverse
My son turned ten just the other day
He said thanks for the ball dad, c'mon let's play
Can you teach me to throw, I said "not today;
I got a lot to do", he said "that's okay"
And he, he walked away but his smile never dimmed, he said
"I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"
And the cats ...
\endverse


\beginverse
Well, he came home college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
"Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like Dad is to borrow the car keys.
See you later, can I have them please?"
And the cats ...

\beginverse
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said "I'd love to dad if I could find the time"
You see, my new job's a hassle and the kid's have the flu
But it's sure nice talkin' to you dad
It's been sure nice talkin' to you
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me,
And the cats ...
\endverse
