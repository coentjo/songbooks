\beginsong{Clementine (Oh my Darling)}[by=]



\beginverse
In a cavern, in a canyon, \brk  Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner, \brk  And his daughter Clementine
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh my darling, oh my darling, \brk  Oh my darling Clementine
You are gone and lost forever, \brk  Dreadfull sorry Clementine
\endchorus

\beginverse
Light she was and like a fairy, \brk  And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes without topses, \brk  Sandles were for Clementine
Drove her ducklings to the water, \brk  Every morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter, \brk  Fell into the foaming brine
\endverse

\beginverse
Ruby lips above the water, \brk  Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But alas, I was no swimmer, \brk  So I lost my Clementine
\endverse

\beginverse
Then the miner, forty-niner, \brk  Soon began to weep and pine
Thought he ought to join his daughter, \brk  Now he's with his Clementine
\endverse

\beginverse
In my dreams she still does haunt me, \brk  Roped in garments soaked in brine
Though in life I used to hug her, \brk  Now she's dead I draw the line
\endverse

\beginverse
How I missed her, how I missed her, \brk  How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister, \brk  And forgot my Clementine
\endverse
