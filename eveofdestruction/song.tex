\beginverse
The eastern world it is explodin', violence flarin', bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin'
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'
\endverse

\beginchorus
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction
\endchorus

\beginverse
Don't you understand, what I'm trying to say?
Can't you feel the fear that I'm feeling today?
If the button is pushed, there's no running away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy
\endverse

\beginchorus
But you tell me over and over ...
\endchorus

\beginverse
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin', I'm sittin' here just contemplatin'
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation, Handful of Senators don't pass legislation
And marches alone can't bring integration, When human respect is disintegratin'
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'
\endverse

\beginchorus
And you tell me over and over ...
\endchorus

\beginverse
Think of all the hate there is in Red China, Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama
Ah, you may leave here for four days in space, But when you return it's the same old place
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace, You can bury your dead but don't leave a trace
Hate your next door neighbor but don't forget to say grace,
\endverse

\beginchorus
And you tell me over and over ...
\endchorus
