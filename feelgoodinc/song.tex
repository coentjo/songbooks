\beginverse
City's breaking down on a camel's back, They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see, And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style, A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep, My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get to sleep, no
\endverse

\beginchorus
Windmill, windmill for the land, Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride, It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free, Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land, Is everybody in?
\endchorus

\beginverse
Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats, Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track, It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear repping in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink, Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc, So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you're cheddar headed, And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha (Ha! Haha.. )
