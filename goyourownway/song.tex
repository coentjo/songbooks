\beginverse
Loving you, Isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, Baby I'd give you my world
How can I, When you won't take it from me?
\endverse

\beginchorus
You can go your own way, Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, Go your own way
\endchorus

\beginverse
Tell me why, Everything turned around
Packing up, Shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could, Baby I'd give you my world
Open up, Everything's waiting for you
\endverse

\beginchorus
You can go your own way, Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, Go your own way
\endchorus
