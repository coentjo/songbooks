{\nolyrics \rep{2}:  \[C] \[Am]}
Now I've \[C]heard there was a \[Am]secret chord, \brk  That \[C]David played, and it \[Am]pleased the Lord
But \[F]you don't really care for \[G]music, \[C]do you? \[G] 
It \[C]goes like this, \brk  The \[Am]fourth, the \[Am/G]fifth, \brk  The \[F]minor fall, the major lift
The \[G]baffled king com\[Em]posing Halle\[Am]lujah, \brk  Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-jah

Your ^faith was strong but you ^needed proof, \brk  You ^saw her bathing ^on the roof
Her ^beauty and the moonlight ^over^threw you ^
She ^tied you to a ^kitchen ^chair, \brk  She ^broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And ^from your lips she ^drew the Halle^lujah, \brk  Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-jah

Baby, I've been here before, I've seen this room and I've walked his floor
You know I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch, and love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah, \brk  Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-jah

%{\nolyrics Intro: \rep{2}:  ^ ^ }
Well, there was a time when you let me know, what's really going on below
But now you never show that to  me do ya?
But remember when I moved in you, And holy doubt was moving too,
And evry breath we take was halleluja,  \brk  Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-jah
\endverse

%{\nolyrics Intro: \rep{2}:  ^ ^ }
Maybe there's a God above, but all I've ever learned from love,
Was how to shield somebody who outdrew you.
And it's not a cry that you hear at night, it's not somebody who's seen the light,
It's a cold and it's a brioken hallelujah, \brk  Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-jah

%You say I took the name in vain

%The holy or the broken Hallelujah

%I did my best, it wasn't much

%With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
