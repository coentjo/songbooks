\beginchorus
intro: \rep{2}:  \[C] \[Am]
\endchorus

\beginverse
Now I've \[C]heard there was a \[Am]secret chord, \brk  That \[C]David played, and it \[Am]pleased the Lord
But \[F]you don't really care for \[G]music, \[C]do you? \[G] 
It \[C]goes like this, \brk  The \[Am]fourth, the \[Am/G]fifth, \brk  The \[F]minor fall, the major lift
The \[G]baffled king com\[Em]posing Halle\[Am]lujah, \brk  Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-\[C]jah

\beginverse
Your ^faith was strong but you ^needed proof, You ^saw her bathing ^on the roof
Her ^beauty and the moonlight ^over^threw you ^
She ^tied you to a ^kitchen ^chair, \brk  She ^broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And ^from your lips she ^drew the Halle^lujah, \brk  Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lu-^u-^jah
\endverse

\beginverse
^Baby, I've been ^here before, I've ^seen this room and I've ^walked his floor
You know I ^used to live al^one before I ^knew you ^
And I've ^seen your flag on the ^marble ^arch, and ^love is not a victory march
It's a ^cold and it's a ^broken ^hallelujah, \brk   Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lu-^u-^jah
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, there ^was a time when you ^let me know, what's ^really going ^on below
But ^now you never ^show that to  me ^do ya? ^
But ^remember when I ^moved in ^you, And ^holy doubt was moving too,
And ^every breath we ^took was halle^luja,  \brk     Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lu-^u-^jah
\endverse

\beginverse
^Maybe there's a ^God above, but ^all I've ever ^learned from love,
Was ^how to shield some^body who out^drew you. ^
And it's ^not a cry that ^you hear at ^night, it's ^not somebody who's seen the light,
It's a ^cold and it's a ^broken halle^lujah, \brk     Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lujah Halle^lu-^u-^jah
\endverse

%You say I took the name in vain
%I don't even know the name
%But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
%There's a blaze of light
%In every word
%It doesn't matter which you heard
%The holy or the broken Hallelujah
%Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-jah

%I did my best, it wasn't much
%I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
%I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
%And even though it all went wrong
%I'll stand before the Lord of Song
%With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
%Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[Am]lujah Halle\[F]lujah Halle\[C]lu-\[G]u-jah
