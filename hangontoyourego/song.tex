\beginverse
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
But what can you tell them
What can you say that wont make them defensive
\endverse

\beginchorus
So, Hang on to your ego
Hang on but I know that you're gonna lose the fight.
\endchorus

\beginverse
They come on like they're peacefull
But inside they're so uptight
They chip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
But how can I say it
How can I come on when I know I'm guilty
\endverse

So, Hang on to your ego
Hang on because I know that you're gonna lose the fight
