\beginverse
I wish you could see me, All broken down this way
But even if you saw me, baby, I know I still couldn't make you stay
Couldn't make you stay
You know about the high cost of loving, But someday, someday
You're gonna have to pay, Gonna have to pay
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh, a woman like you needs fine things, And I knew it from the start
And I don't have much to offer, Just this old broken heart, hey baby
Just this old broken heart
But if heartaches were nickels, I wouldn't be here crying in the dark
\endverse

\beginverse
If wine and pills were hundred dollar, bills, I might keep you satisfied
And if broken dreams were limousines, I might take you for a ride
And all I can do is think of you, And wish you were here by my side,
Yes, if heartaches were nickels, I'd be the richest fool alive.
\endverse
