\beginverse
They hung a sign up in our town, \brk "if you live it up, you won't \brk  live it down"
So, she left Monte Rio, son, \brk  Just like a bullet leaves a gun
With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips, \brk  She went and took that California trip
Well, the moon was gold, her, \brk  Hair like wind
She said don't look back just, \brk  Come on Jim
Oh you got to, \brk  Hold on, Hold on, \brk  You got to hold on
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, \brk  You gotta hold on
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, he gave her a dimestore watch, \brk  And a ring made from a spoon
Everyone is looking for someone to blame, \brk  But you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops, \brk  You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby, I still love you, \brk  Sometimes there's nothin left to do
Hold on ...
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, God bless your crooked little heart St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken-china voice, \brk  How I wish you were still here with me
Well, you build it up, you wreck it down, \brk  You burn your mansion to the ground
When there's nothing left to keep you here, when, \brk  You're falling behind in this, \brk  Big blue world
Hold on ...
\endverse

\beginverse
Down by the Riverside motel,, \brk  It's 10 below and falling
By a 99 cent store she closed her eyes, \brk  And started swaying
But it's so hard to dance that way, \brk  When it's cold and there's no music
Well your old hometown is so far away, \brk  But, inside your head there's a record, \brk  That's playing, a song called
Hold on ...
\endverse
