\beginverse
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me
\endverse

\beginchorus
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
(I) was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking

And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"

(2x)  Yeah, yeah, yeah,  No, no
\endchorus

\beginverse
It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
\endverse
