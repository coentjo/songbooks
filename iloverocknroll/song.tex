Joan Jett â€“ I Love Rock N' Roll Lyrics
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine 
I knew he must a been about seventeen 
The beat was goin' strong 
Playin' my favorite song 
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long 
Till he was with me, yeah me, 
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long 
Till he was with me, yeah me, singin' 

I love rock n' roll 
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby 
I love rock n' roll 
So come an' take your time an' dance with me 

He smiled so I got up and' asked for his name 
That don't matter, he said, 
'Cause it's all the same 
Said can I take you home where we can be alone 
An' next we were movin' on 
He was with me, yeah me 
Next we were movin' on 
He was with me, yeah me singin'

I love rock n' roll 
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby 
I love rock n' roll 
So come an' take your time an' dance with me 

Said can I take you home where we can be alone 
Next we're movin' on
He was with me, yeah me 
And we'll be movin' on 
An' singin' that same old song 
Yeah with me, singin' 

I love rock n' roll 
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby 
I love rock n' roll 
So come an' take your time an' dance with me

I love rock n' roll 
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby 
I love rock n' roll 
So come an' take your time an' dance with

I love rock n' roll 
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby 
I love rock n' roll 
So come an' take your time an' dance with 

I love rock n' roll 
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby 
I love rock n' roll 
So come an' take your time an' dance with 

I love rock n' roll 
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby 
I love rock n' roll 
So come an' take your time an' dance with me
