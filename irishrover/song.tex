\beginsong{The Irish Rover }[by={The Pogues}]


\beginverse
On the \[G]4th of July, 180\[C]6,   \brk   We set \[G]sail from the sweet cove of \[D]Cork
We were \[G]sailing away with a cargo of \[C]bricks,   \brk   For the \[D]Grand City Hall in New \[G]York

'Twas a \[G]wonderful craft, she was \[D]rigged fore and aft,   \brk   And \[G]oh, how the wild wind \[D]drove her
She stood \[G]several blasts, she had twenty seven \[C]masts,   \brk   And they \[G]called her The Irish \[D]Ro\[G]ver
\endverse



\beginverse
We had ^one million bags of the best Sligo ^rags,   \brk   We had ^two million barrels of ^stone
We had ^three million sides of old blind horses ^hides,   \brk   We had ^four million barrels of ^bones

We had ^five million hogs and ^six million dogs,   \brk   ^Seven million barrels of ^porter
We had ^eight million bails of old nanny-goats' ^tails,   \brk   In the ^hold of the Irish ^Ro^ver
\endverse



\beginverse
There was ^awl Mickey Coote who played hard on his ^flute,   \brk   When the ^ladies lined up for a ^set
He was ^tootin' with skill for each sparkling ^quadrille,   \brk   Though the ^dancers were fluther'd and ^bet
\endverse

\beginverse*
With his ^smart witty talk, he was ^cock of the walk,   \brk   And he ^rolled the dames under and ^over
They all ^knew at a glance when he took up his ^stance,   \brk   That he ^sailed in The Irish ^Ro^ver
\endverse

\beginverse
There was ^Barney McGee from the banks of the ^Lee,   \brk   There was ^Hogan from County Ty^rone
There was ^Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of ^work,   \brk   And a ^man from Westmeath called Ma^lone

There was ^Slugger O'Toole who was ^drunk as a rule,   \brk   And ^Fighting Bill Treacy from ^Dover
And your ^man, Mick MacCann from the banks of the ^Bann,   \brk   Was the ^skipper of the Irish ^Ro^ver
\endverse

\beginverse
We had ^sailed seven years when the measles broke ^out,   \brk   And the ^ship lost its way in the ^fog
And that ^whale of a crew was reduced down to ^two,   \brk   Just my^self and the Captain's old ^dog

Then the ^ship struck a rock, oh ^Lord, what a shock,   \brk   The ^bulkhead was turned right ^over
Turned ^nine times around and the poor old dog was ^drowned,   \brk   I'm the ^last of The Irish ^Ro^ver
\endverse
