\beginverse
Well she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind.
\endverse

\beginverse
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles, she gives to me free
It's alright she says it's alright
Take anything you want from me,
Anything.
\endverse

\beginverse
Fly on little wing,
Yeah yeah, yeah, little wing
