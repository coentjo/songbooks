\beginverse
Decisions as I \[C]go, to anywhere \[Em]I flow.
Sometimes I be\[Am]lieve, a time where we \[F]should know.
I can't fly \[C]high, I can't \[Em]go long.
Today I got a \[Am]million, tomorrow, I \[F]don't know.

\beginverse
Stop crying like you're \[C]home and think about \[Em]the show.
We're all playing the \[Am]same game, I'm laying \[F]down along.
We're unknown and \[C]wrong, special when I \[Em]come.
Hate will make you \[Am]cautious, love will make you \[F]glow.
\endverse

\beginverse
Make me feel the \[C]warm, make me feel the \[Em]cold.
It's written in our \[Am]story, it's written on the \[F]walls.
This is our \[C]call, we rise and we \[Em]fall.
Dancin' in the \[Am]moonlight, don't we have it \[F]all?
