\beginverse
In\[Am] this world you \[Em]tried
Not \[F]leaving me alone \[C]\[G]behind.
\[Am]here's no other way.
I prayed to the gods let him stay.
The memories ease the pain inside,
Now I know why.

All of my memories keep you near.
In silent moments imagine you here.

Your silent whispers, silent tears.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Made me promise I'd try
To find my way back in this life.
I hope there is a way
To give me a sign you're OK.
Reminds me again it's worth it all
So I can go on.

Together in all these memories
I see your smile.
All the memories I hold dear.
Darling, you know I will love you
'Til the end of time.
