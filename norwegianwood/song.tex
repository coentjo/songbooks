\beginsong{Norwegian Wood}[by=Beatles]

\beginverse
I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
\endverse

\beginverse
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
\endverse

\beginverse
I sat on the rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"
\endverse

\beginverse
She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
\endverse

\beginverse
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
\endverse
