\beginverse
\[D F C F C] \[D]Old man look at my life, Twenty four, and there's so much more,
Live alone in a paradise, That makes me think of two.
Love lost, such a cost, Give me things, that don't get lost.
Like a coin that won't get tossed, Rolling home to you.

\beginchorus
Old man take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you,
I need someone to love me, the whole day through.
Ah, one look in my eyes, and you can tell that's true.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Lullabies, look in your eyes, Run around the same old town.
Doesn't mean that much to me, To mean that much to you.
I've been first and last, Look at how the time goes past.
But I'm all alone at last. Rolling home to you.
\endverse
