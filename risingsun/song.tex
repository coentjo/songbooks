There \[Am]is a \[C]house in \[D]New Or\[F]leans,
They \[Am]call the `\[C]Rising \[E7]Sun',

\beginverse
My mother was a tailor,
She sewed my new blue jeans,
My father was a gambling man,
down in New Orleans.
\endverse

\beginverse
Now the only only thing a gambler needs
is a suitcase and a trunk 
and the only time he'll be satisfied
is when he's all a drunk
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done -
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of Rising Sun
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, I got one foot on the platform,
The other's on the train,
I'm going back to New Orleans,
to wear that ball and chain.
