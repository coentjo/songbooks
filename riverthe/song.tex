\beginsong{The River}[by=Bruce Springsteen]


%{\nolyrics Intro: \[E] \[G] \[A]}


\beginverse
I come from down in the valley, \brk  where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school, \brk  when she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
\endverse

\beginverse
We'd go down to the river, \brk  And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride
\endverse

\beginverse
Then I got Mary pregnant, \brk  and man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse, \brk  and the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress
\endverse

\beginverse
That night we went down to the river, \brk  And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride
\endverse

\beginverse
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important, \brk  Well mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember, \brk  Mary acts like she don't care
\endverse

\beginverse
But I remember us riding in my brother's car, \brk  Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me, \brk  they haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true, \brk  Or is it something worse
that sends me down to the river, \brk  though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Down to the river, \brk  my baby and I, \brk  Oh down to the river we ride 
\endverse
