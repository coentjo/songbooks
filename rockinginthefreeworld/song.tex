There's \[Em]colors on the street \[D] \[C]  , \brk  Red, \[Em]white and blue \[D] \[C]   
People \[Em]shufflin' their feet \[D] \[C]   , \brk  People \[Em]sleepin' in their shoes \[D] \[C]   
But there's a \[Em]warnin' sign on the \[D]road a\[C]head
There's a \[Em]lot of people sayin' we'd be \[D]better off \[C]dead
Don't \[Em]feel like Satan, but I \[D]am to \[C]them
So I \[Em]try to forget it, any \[D]way I \[C]can.

\beginverse
I see a woman in the night, \brk  With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light, \brk  Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done to it
There's one more kid, that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool.

\beginverse
We got a thousand points of light, \brk  For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler, \brk  Machine gun hand
We got department stores, \brk  and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes, \brk  for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, \brk  says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, \brk  got roads to drive.
