\beginverse
The neon light, of the open all night,
was just in time replaced by magic appearance of a new day-while,
a melancholic reno was crawling on his back just in, front of the supermarket door- way child
\endverse

\beginverse
hey girl on a cold sommer night, as we stood on the corner
as a man passed by and asked us, what we doeing what we need
as he pointed his big fat finger, to the people hanginground
at corner of the-other side of street, oh well
\endverse

\beginverse
doin' nothing, just hanging around, what do you mean doin' nothing sir
so we had to hit him to the ground, doin' nothing just hanging around
his head all busted looking just a little to wise- child
\endverse

\beginverse
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
I just can't wait for saterday night, for saterday night, for saterday night
saterday night, saterday night, saterday night, saterday night
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
\endverse
