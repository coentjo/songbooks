\beginverse
Pretty little hair-do don't do what it used to
Can't disguise the living
All the miles that we've been through
Looking like a train wreck
Wearing too much makeup
The burden that you carry
Is more than one soul could ever bare
\endverse

\beginchorus
Don't look so sad, Marina
There's another part to play
Don't look so sad, Marina
Save it for a rainy day  (3x)
\endchorus

\beginverse
You never make your mind up
Like driving with your eyes shut
Rough around the edges
Won't someone come and take you home
Waiting for a breakthrough
What will you set your mind to?
We stood outside the Chinese restaurant
In the rain
\endverse

\beginchorus
Don't look so sad, Marina
There's another part to play
Don't look so sad, Marina
Save it for a rainy day  (3x)
\endchorus
