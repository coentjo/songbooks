\beginverse
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary \& thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
Parsely, sage, rosemary \& thyme
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)
Without no seams nor needlework
(Blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsely, sage, rosemary, \& thyme
(Washed is the ground with so many tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
(War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsely, sage, rosemary \& thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
\endverse

\beginverse
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary \& thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine.
