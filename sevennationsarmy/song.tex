I'm gonna \[ \K ]fight 'em off, \brk  A seven nation \[ \K ]army couldn't hold me back.
They're gonna \[\K]rip it off, \brk  Taking their time \[\K]right behind my back.
And I'm \[\K]talking to myself at night, \brk  Because I can't for\[\K]get. 
\[\K]Back and forth through my mind, \brk  Behind a ciga\[\K]rette.
And the \[G]message coming from my \[A]eyes, \brk  Says leave it a\[\K (voluit)]lone. \[ \M \ \ \K \ \ \M \ \ , G A ]

Don't want to hear about it, \brk  Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it, \brk  From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it coming back my way, \brk  I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, \brk  But thats what I'll do
And the \[G]feeling coming from my \[A]bones, \brk  Says find a \[\K (voluit)]home \[ \M \ \ \K \ \ \M , \ \ \K \ \ \M \ \ \K \ \ \M \ \ , G A ]

I'm going to Wichita, \brk  Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw, \brk  Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, \brk  Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me, \brk  And I will think no more
And the \[G]stains coming from my \[A]blood, \brk  Tell me go back \[\K (voluit)]home \[ \M \ \ \K \ \ \M \ \ , G A ]
