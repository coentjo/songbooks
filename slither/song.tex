\beginverse
Hey Hey Hey, When you look you see right through me,
Cut the rope, fell to my knees, Born and broken every single time.

Always keep me under finger, That's the spot where you run to me
Might see some type of pleasure in my mind
\endverse

\beginverse
Yeah, here comes the water, It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time you see, Hey hey hey
\endverse

\beginverse
When you seek me you destroy me
Rape my mind and smell the poppies
Born and bloodied every single time

Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you might linger
But I see some type of pleasure in my mind
\endverse

\beginverse
Yeah, here comes the water, It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time you see, Like holy water, It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time with me
\endverse

Born and Bloodied
Every single time

\beginverse
Yeah, here comes the water, It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time you see, Like holy water, It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time with me, Hey, hey, hey
