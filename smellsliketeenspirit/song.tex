intro: \rep{2}  \[ F5 A\#5 G\#5 C\#5 ]
\[F5]Load up \[A\#5]on \[G\#5] guns and \[C\#5]bring your \[F5]friends
It's fun \[A\#5]to \[G\#]lose and to \[C\#5]pre\[F5]tend
She's o\[A\#5]ver-\[G\#5]bored and self\[C\#5]-as\[F5]sured
Oh no, \[A\#5]I \[g\#5]know a dir\[C\#5]ty \[F5]word
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hello, \[G\#5]hello, \[A\#5]hello, \[C\#5]how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
\[ F5 F5 F\#5]hey \[ F5 F5 A\#5 G\#5 ]
\[ F5 F5 F\#5]hey \[ F5 F5 A\#5 G\#5 ]

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hello, hello ...
\endchorus

\beginverse
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
...
...  my libido

(9x):  A denial
