\beginsong{Smells like teen spirit}[by=Nirvana]


\beginverse
Load up on guns and bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us

A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey, yay
\endchorus

\beginverse
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end
\endverse

\beginchorus
Hello, hello ...
\endchorus

\beginverse
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind
\endverse

\beginverse
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
...

(9x):  A denial
