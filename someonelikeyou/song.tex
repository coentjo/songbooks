%{\nolyrics Intro: \[E] \[G] \[A]}


\beginverse
I heard that you're settled down, \brk  That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true, \brk  Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?, \brk  Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
\endverse

\beginverse
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited, \brk  But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face, \brk  And that you'd be reminded that, for me, it isn't over
\endverse

\beginchorus
Never mind, I'll find someone like you, \brk  I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, \brk  I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
\endchorus

\beginverse
You know how the time flies, \brk  Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze, \brk  Bound by the surprise of our glory days
\endverse

\beginverse
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited, \brk  But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face, \brk  And that you'd be reminded that, for me, it isn't over
\endverse

\beginchorus
Never mind, I'll find someone like you, \brk  I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, \brk  I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
\endchorus

\beginverse
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
\endverse

\beginchorus
\rep{2} 
Never mind, I'll find someone like you, \brk  I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, \brk  I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead  (2x)
