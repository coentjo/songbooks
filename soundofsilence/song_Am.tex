\beginverse
\[Em] Hello darkness, my old \[D]friend, \brk  I've come to talk to you \[Em]again
Because a vision softly \[C]cree\[G]ping, \brk  Left its seeds while I was \[C]slee\[G]ping
And the \[C]vision that was planted in my \[G]brain, \brk  Still \[Em]remains \[G]
Within the \[D]sound of \[Em]silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^ In restless dreams I walked ^alone, \brk  Narrow streets of cobble^stone
‘Neath the halo of a ^street^lamp, \brk  I turned my collar to the ^cold and ^damp
When my ^eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon ^light, \brk  That split the ^night ^
And touched the ^sound of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^ And in the naked light I ^saw, \brk  Ten thousand people, maybe ^more
People talking without ^spea^king, \brk  People hearing without ^liste^ning
People writing ^songs that voices never ^share, \brk  No one ^dare  ^
Disturb the ^sound of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^ “Fools” said I, “You do not ^know, \brk  Silence like a cancer ^grows
Hear my words that I might ^teach ^you, \brk  Take my arms that I might ^reach ^you”
But my ^words like silent raindrops ^fell ^, \brk  And ^echoed in the ^wells of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^And the people bowed and ^prayed, \brk  To the neon god they ^made
And the sign flashed out its ^war^ning, \brk  In the words that it was ^for^ming
And (the sign said) “The ^words of the prophets, \brk  Are written on subway ^walls and tenement ^halls
And ^whispered in the ^sounds of ^silence”
\endverse
