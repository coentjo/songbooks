\beginsong{The Sound Of Silence (in Em)}[by=Simon \& Garfunkel]


%{\nolyrics Intro: \[Em]}


\beginverse
\[Em] Hello darkness, my old \[D]friend
I've come to talk to you \[Em]again
Because a vision softly \[C]cree\[G]ping
Left its seeds while I was \[C]slee\[G]ping
And the \[C]vision that was planted in my \[G]brain
Still \[Em]remains \[G]
Within the \[D]sound of \[Em]silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^ In restless dreams I walked ^alone
Narrow streets of cobble^stone
‘Neath the halo of a ^street^lamp
I turned my collar to the ^cold and ^damp
When my ^eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon ^light
That split the ^night ^
And touched the ^sound of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^ And in the naked light I ^saw
Ten thousand people, maybe ^more
People talking without ^spea^king
People hearing without ^liste^ning
People writing ^songs that voices never ^share
No one ^dare  ^
Disturb the ^sound of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^ “Fools” said I, “You do not ^know
Silence like a cancer ^grows
Hear my words that I might ^teach ^you
Take my arms that I might ^reach ^you”
But my ^words like silent raindrops ^fell ^
And ^echoed in the ^wells of ^silence
\endverse

\beginverse
^And the people bowed and ^prayed
To the neon god they ^made
And the sign flashed out its ^war^ning
In the words that it was ^for^ming
And (the sign said) “The ^words of the prophets
Are written on subway ^walls
And tenement ^halls
And ^whispered in the ^sounds of ^silence” 
\endverse
