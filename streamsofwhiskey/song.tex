\beginverse
\[D]Last night as I slept, I \[G]dreamt I met with \[D]Behan
I shook him by the hand and we \[E]passed the time of \[A]day
When \[D]questioned on his views, On the \[G]crux of life's phi\[D]losophies.
He \[D]had but these \[G]few clear and \[A]simple words to \[D]say.
I am \[D]going, I am \[G]go-\[D]ing, Any \[D]which way the wind may be \[G]blo-\[A]wing,
I am \[D]going, I am \[G]go-\[D]ing, Where \[D]streams of \[G]whiskey are \[A]flo-\[D]wing.

\beginverse
I have cursed, bled and sworn, Jumped bail and landed up in jail
Life has often tried to stretch me, But the rope always was slack
And now that I've a pile, I'll go down to the Chelsea
I'll walk in on my feet, But I'll leave there on my back
Because I am going, I am going, Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going, Where streams of whiskey are flowing.
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh the words that he spoke, Seemed the wisest of philosophies
There's nothing ever gained, By a wet thing called a tear
When the world is too dark, And I need the light inside of me
I'll walk into a bar, And drink fifteen pints of beer
Iam going, I am going, Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going, Where streams of whiskey are flowing
I am going, I am going, Any which way the wind may be blowing
I am going, I am going, Where streams of whiskey are flowing
Where streams of whiskey are flowing
Where streams of whiskey are flowing
