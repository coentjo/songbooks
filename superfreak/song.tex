\beginverse
She's a very kinky girl, The kind you don't take home to mother;
She will never let your spirits down, Once you get her off the street.

She likes the boys in the band, She says that I'm her all time fav'rite;
When I make my move to her room, It's the right time; she's never hard to please.

That girl is pretty wild now; The girl's a super freak;
The kind of girl you read about, In the new wave magazines.
That girl is pretty kinky; The girl's a super freak;
I'd really like to taste her, Ev'ry time we meet.
She's all right; she's all right; That girl's all right with me yeah.
She's a super freak, super freak, She's super freaky; super freak, super freak.

She's a very special girl, From her head down to her toenails;
Yet she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends, In a limousine.

Three's not a crowd to her, she said; "Room 714, I'll be waiting."
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles; It's such a freaky scene.

That girl is pretty wild now; The girl's a super freak;
The kind of girl you read about, In the new wave magazines.
That girl is pretty kinky; The girl's a super freak;
I'd really like to taste her, Ev'ry time we meet.
She's all right; she's all right; That girl's all right with me yeah.
She's a super freak, super freak, She's super freaky; super freak, super freak.
Temptations sing; oh, super freak, Super freak, the girl's a super freak; oh.

\beginverse
She's a very kinky girl, The kind you don't take home to mother;
She will never let your spirits down, Once you get her off the street.
