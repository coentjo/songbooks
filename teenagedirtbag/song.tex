\beginsong{Teenage Dirtbag }[by=Wheatus]


%{\nolyrics Intro: \[E] \[G] \[A]}


\beginverse
Her name is Noelle  \brk  I have a dream about her
She rings my bell  \brk  I got gym class in half an hour

Oh, how she rocks  \brk  In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am  \brk  And she doesn't give a damn about me
\endverse

\beginchorus
Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo
\endchorus

\beginverse
Her boyfriend's a dick  \brk  He brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick  \brk  My ass if he knew the truth

He lives on my block  \brk  And he drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am  \brk  And he doesn't give a damn about me
\endverse

\beginchorus
Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo

Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
\endchorus

\beginverse
Man I feel like mould  \brk  It's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold  \brk  She's walking over to me

This must be fake  \brk  My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?  \brk  And why does she give a damn about me?

She says, "I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden Baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby like you"
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missing
\endchorus
