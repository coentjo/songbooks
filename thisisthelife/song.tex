\beginsong{This is the life}[by=Amy Macdonald]

\begin{LARGE}

%\beginchorus
%intro: \rep{2}:  \[C] \[Am]
%\endchorus

\beginverse
Oh the wind whistles down, The cold dark street tonight.
And the people they were dancing, To the music vibe.
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs get louder each one better than before
\endverse

\beginchorus
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
\endchorus

\beginverse
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for 4
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til 4
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
And where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?
\endverse

\beginchorus
[3x]  And you're singing the songs ...
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
\endchorus
