This shit, that ice cold, Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one, for them hood girls, Them good girls, straight masterpieces
Stylin', while in, Livin' it up in the city,
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent, Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty
\endverse

\beginchorus
I'm too hot (hot damn), Called a police and a fireman
I'm too hot (hot damn), Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I'm too hot (hot damn), Say my name, you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot damn), Am I bad 'bout that money?  \ \ \   Break it down

(3x) Girls hit your hallelujah (wooh)
(3x) 'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you (wooh)
Saturday night, and we in the spot
(6x) Don't believe me, just watch, (come on!)
Hey, hey, hey, oh!
\endchorus

\beginverse
Stop, Wait a minute, Fill my cup, put some liquor in it, Take a sip, sign a check

Julio, get the stretch, Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon' show out, Smoother than a fresh jar of skippy
\endverse

\beginchorus
I'm too hot (hot damn), Called a police and a fireman...
\endchorus

\beginverse
Before we leave, I'mma tell y'all a lil' something
(8x) Uptown Funk you up

Come on, dance, jump on it, If you sexy than flaunt it
If you freaky than own it, Don't brag about it, come show me
Come on, dance, jump on it, If you sexy than flaunt it
Well, it's Saturday night, and we in the spot, Don't believe me, just watch, come on!
