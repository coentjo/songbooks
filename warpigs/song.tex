\beginsong{War Pigs}[by=Black Sabbath]

%\beginchorus
%intro: \rep{2}:  \[C] \[Am]

\beginverse
Generals gathered in their masses,
just like witches at black masses.
Evil minds that plot destruction,
sorcerer of death's construction.
In the fields the bodies burning,
as the war machine keeps turning.
Death and hatred to mankind,
poisoning their brainwashed minds...Oh lord yeah!
\endverse

\beginverse
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor
\endverse

\beginverse
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait `till their judgement day comes, yeah!
\endverse

\beginverse
Now in darkness, world stops turning,
ashes where the bodies burning.
No more war pigs have the power,
hand of god has struck the hour.
Day of judgement, god is calling,
on their knees the war pigs crawling.
Begging mercy for their sins,
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings...Oh lord, yeah!
\endverse
