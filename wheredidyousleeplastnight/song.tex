\beginverse
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me, Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines, Where the sun don't ever shine,
I would shiver the whole night through
\endverse

\beginverse
My girl, my girl, where will you go, I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines, Where the sun don't ever shine,
I would shiver the whole night through
\endverse

\beginverse
Her husband, was a hard working man, Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel, But his body never was found
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines, Where the sun don't ever shine,
I would shiver the whole night through
\endverse
