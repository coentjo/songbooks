\beginverse
\[Em] Another h\[C]ead hangs lowly,   \brk   Ch\[G]ild is slowly \[D]taken
\[Em]And the violence \[C]caused such silence,   \brk   \[G]Who are we mis\[D]taken

But you \[Em]see it's not me,   \brk   It's not \[C]my family
In your \[G]head, in your head,   \brk   They are \[D]fighting
With their \[Em]tanks and their bombs,   \brk   And their \[C]bombs and their guns
In your \[G]head,   \brk   In your head they are \[D]cryin'
\endverse

In your h\[Em]ead, in your \[C]head, , \brk  Zomb\[G]ie, zombie, zomb\[D]ie, Hey, hey
What's in your h\[Em]ead, in your h\[C]ead, , \brk  Zomb\[G]ie, zombie, zomb\[D]ie
\[Em] Hey, hey, hey, oh, \brk  \[C]Dou, dou, dou, dou

^Another ^mother's breakin',   \brk   ^Heart is taking ^over
^When the violence ^causes silence,   \brk   ^We must be mis^taken

It's the ^same old theme since ^nineteen-sixteen
In your ^head,   \brk   In your head they're still ^fightin'
With their ^tanks and their bombs,   \brk   And their ^bombs and their guns
In your ^head, in your head they are ^dyin'
