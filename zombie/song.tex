\beginverse
\[Em] Another\[G] h\[Cmaj7]ead hangs lowly,   \brk   Ch\[G]ild is slowly \[D]taken
\[Em]And the viole\[G]nce c\[Cmaj7]aused such silence,   \brk   Wh\[G]o are we mist\[D]aken

But you see it's not me,   \brk   It's not my family
In your head, in your head,   \brk   They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs,   \brk   And their bombs and their guns
In your head,,   \brk   In your head they are cryin'
\endverse

\beginchorus
In your h\[Em]ead, in your h\[C]ead, \brk  Zomb\[G]ie, zombie, zomb\[D]ie, \brk  Hey, hey
What's in your h\[Em]ead, in your h\[C]ead, Zomb\[G]ie, zombie, zomb\[D]ie
\[Em] Hey, hey, hey, oh
\[C]Dou, dou, dou, dou
\[G]Dou, dou, dou, dou
\[D]Dou, dou, dou, dou
Dou, dou, dou, dou

\beginverse
Another mother's breakin',   \brk   Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence,   \brk   We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen
In your head,   \brk   In your head they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs,   \brk   And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head they are dyin'
\endverse

\beginchorus
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, ya, ya-a
